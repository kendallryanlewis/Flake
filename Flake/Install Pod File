/*********** Install/Add  Pod files *************/
CocoaPods is used to install and manage dependencies in existing Xcode projects.

Create an Xcode project, and save it to your local machine.
Create a file named Podfile in your project directory. This file defines your project's dependencies, and is commonly referred to as a Podspec.
Open Podfile, and add your dependencies. A simple Podspec is shown here:

target 'Example' do
# IMPORTANT: Make sure use_frameworks! is included at the top of the file
use_frameworks!

pod 'UICircularProgressRing'
end

Save the file.
Open a terminal and cd to the directory containing the Podfile.

$ cd <path-to-project>/project/
Run the pod install command. This will install the SDKs specified in the Podspec, along with any dependencies they may have.

$ pod update
Open your app's .xcworkspace file to launch Xcode. Use this file for all development on your app.
